==============================

niftyled is an open source project to control LED devices using pixmaps.

It's written in C and designed to provide a lightweight and versatile
framework to... 

* ...create new light setups quickly 
* ...scale - so big setups can be created with least hardware effort 
* ...support a wide range of hardware 
* ...combine different hardware in the same setup 
* ...provide maximum freedom for software developers when integrating niftyled
    with other lighting applications 
* ...provide maximum freedom for hardware developers by using a versatile
    abstraction design 
* ...minimize the needed firmware complexity
