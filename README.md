Niftyled LED display framework
==============================

niftyled is an open source project to control LED devices using pixmaps.

It's written in C and designed to provide a lightweight and versatile
framework to... 

* ...create new light setups quickly
* ...scale - so big setups can be created with least hardware effort
* ...support a wide range of hardware
* ...combine different LED hardware and different interfaces (USB, RS232, ...) in the same setup
* ...provide maximum freedom for software developers when integrating niftyled with other lighting applications
* ...provide maximum freedom for hardware developers by using a versatile abstraction design
* ...minimize the needed firmware complexity
